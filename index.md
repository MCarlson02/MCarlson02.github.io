### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 was the first time I actually understood what I was doing. It was the
    first time I understood how the make commands worked and how to test and
    improve my code. The MadLib premise was fun and taught how to prompt the
    user well.


* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was interesting because part 2 introduced the HiLo game, which would
    later be iterated on 2 more times. It was the beginning of learning how to
    create a playable game. It was also a great example of how my skills have
    improved when compared to the two other, more advanced, versions of
    the game.

* Lab 6

    I appreciated Lab 6 because I really struggled with it. Part 2, blackjack,
    was very difficult for me and the difficulty allowed me to really improve
    when it finally did click. Understanding how if statements work is integral
    to coding as a whole.
